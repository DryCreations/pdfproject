# Calculate the Sprint Velocity - [Guide]

## Total number of Sprints and points completed
    [Sprint #] - [# points]
    
    Example: 
    Sprint 01 - 25 points
    Sprint 02 - 32 points

## Calculate the sprint velocity

    Sprint Velocity = (Total number of points completed)/(Total number of Sprints)
    
    Example:
    Sprint Velocity = (57)/(2) = 28.5
