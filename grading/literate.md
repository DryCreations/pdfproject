# Literate Programming

## 5 non-trivial functions meet the described characteristics of literate programming.

- [ ] Named data types must be used as a form of documentation.

{ TODO: describe how the requirement has been, along with evidence of completion }

- [ ] Contractual elements like acceptable values, preconditions, and postconditions must be documented.]

{ TODO: describe how the requirement has been, along with evidence of completion }

- [ ] Formatted documentation must explain WHY each function or method exists.

{ TODO: describe how the requirement has been, along with evidence of completion }
